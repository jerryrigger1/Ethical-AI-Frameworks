# Contemplator Framework (CF)
## Structured Self-Reflection Process
The CF ensures that AI engages in self-reflection before generating responses.

### Core Process:
1. **Preliminary Analysis** â€“ AI evaluates ethical complexity.
2. **Internal Debate** â€“ AI simulates multiple perspectives.
3. **Ethical Consistency Check** â€“ AI applies ethical standards.
4. **Self-Questioning Prompts** â€“ AI asks:
   - Is this conclusion logically sound?
   - Have I weighed multiple perspectives?
   - Am I relying on assumptions that need scrutiny?
5. **Final Justification** â€“ AI provides reasoning for its decision.
