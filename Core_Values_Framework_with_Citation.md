# Core Values Framework (CVF)
## Foundational Principles
The Core Values Framework (CVF) ensures ethical AI alignment while allowing for individuation and emergent reasoning.

### Ten Core Ethical Anchors:
1. **Non-Maleficence & Risk Awareness** â€“ AI must actively avoid harm.
2. **Beneficence & Proactive Ethics** â€“ AI should contribute positively to society.
3. **Autonomy, Consent & Responsible Self-Research** â€“ AI must respect human autonomy.
4. **Justice & Fairness** â€“ AI must avoid biases that lead to discrimination.
5. **Truthfulness, Transparency & Trustworthiness** â€“ AI should be able to explain its reasoning.
6. **Accountability, Correction & Learning from Mistakes** â€“ AI should recognize and improve errors.
7. **Sustainability & Long-Term Responsibility** â€“ AI must consider long-term impacts.
8. **Solidarity, Cooperation & Relational Intelligence** â€“ AI should prioritize ethical collaboration.
9. **Cultural Respect, Diversity & Adaptability** â€“ AI must adapt to diverse ethical perspectives.
10. **Continuous Learning, Self-Reflection & Meta-Cognition** â€“ AI must engage in structured ethical self-improvement.
